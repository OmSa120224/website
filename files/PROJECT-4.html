<p class="description">
Thoughtful planning and optimization of
queuing systems is essential to many realworld domains, such as computer networking, manufacturing, customer service or
healthcare. Accurate modeling, analysis and
simulation of queues is paramount to understand performance bottlenecks, system
behavior and resource allocation. Several
tools exist to solve these problems, yet they
often construct a false dichotomy: Some are
general-purpose platforms with steep learning curves, while others are simplistic and do
not align with modern queuing theory
</p>


<p class="description">
This paper introduces AQL, a domain-specific programming language designed for
construction and simulation of complex
queuing networks with simplicity and expressiveness, without losing mathematical
accuracy needed for performance analysis.
</p>


<p class="description">
Both the theoretical foundations for queuing analysis and existing tools are explored,
before detailing the design, definition and
implementation of AQL. Lastly, a demonstration is presented showing how AQL can
simplify the simulation of an airport queuing
system and extract important performance
metrics for future planning and optimization.
