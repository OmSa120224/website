This project explores the collaborative
learning environment at Aalborg University. It focuses on understanding
and improving upon the current dynamics of doing coding exercises in
study groups. Research has shown
that currently at Aalborg University,
there is no tool for facilitating collaborative coding in study groups. To try
and tackle this issue, CoCo has been
developed to enhance the collaborative coding experience among study
groups at AAU, while having the capabilities to congregate many different
courses, lectures, and exercises on a
single web platform.

CoCo successfully provides real-time
collaborative coding and instant feedback, smoothening the learning process for inexperienced coders. Using
technologies such as Yjs and CodeMirror, CoCo ensures conflict free collaboration between users. Furthermore
with an integration of Judge0 CoCo is
able to execute and display the result
of code written by users.
