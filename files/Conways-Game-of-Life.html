<p class="description">
Conway's Game of Life implemented as a C# console application.
The game is a cellular automaton with four rules:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (under-population).</li>
    <li>- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
    <li>- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (over-population).</li>
    <li>- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).</li>
</ul>
