<p class="description"> 
This project was made in collaboration with
<i>blank</i>, focusing on their lack of a dedicated
system for storing their split test data.
After conducting an initial interview, it was
revealed that they currently share split test
results via ‘word of mouth’ and Slack. From
this, an initial problem statement was
formed:

</p>

<i class="description">How can a system be developed to store the results of split tests, while accounting for the needs and requirements of blank?</i>


<p class="description">
  Using FACTOR and rich pictures, a system
definition was formulated; thereafter, an
analysis of the problem- and application
domain was conducted. Together with a
MoSCoW model and system design the
baseline for the system requirements was
formed.
</p>

<p class="description">
The Split Test Platform successfully
provides a web application to handle split
test data, addressing most of <i>blanks</i> needs.
Using technologies such as React, Spring,
and Cloudflare R2 the system can efficiently
handle and store split test data along with
associated images. Furthermore, the system
provides a user-friendly interface giving
users a visual representation of the given
data.
