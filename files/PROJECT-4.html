<p class="description"> AQL is a domain-specific language for modeling and simulating queuing networks. The language was developed by first defining its formal syntax and semantics: the static semantics ensures the models are valid and consistent according to the rules of the language, while the dynamic semantics defines how the models behave during simulation. ANTLR was then used to generate a parser that translates models into executable simulations.
     AQL combines simplicity with mathematical accuracy for performance analysis and supports efficient simulation of queuing systems such as airports. </p>
