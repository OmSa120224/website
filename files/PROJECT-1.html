    This project aims to create a solution that minimizes the consequences of long patient 
    waiting times in the Danish healthcare system by prioritizing those who need help the most.
    Additionally, this requires the scope of the project to be narrowed down, so as to accurately 
    find a concise angle to the problem. This includes an introduction to the Danish healthcare systems 
    and all of its issues, as well as the methodologies of creating an appointment system. 
    The project also revolves around the process of creating an appointment system to a radiology department,
    which involves the decision making for the design as well as the implementation of the product. 
    Afterwards, an evaluation of the process and of the product itself is made, discussing how the product 
    compares to the original vision, together with how it could be improved in the future.
