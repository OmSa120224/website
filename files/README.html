<p class="description">
I am a computer science student at Aalborg University. I started my studies in September 2023 and expected to graduate in July 2026.

About the projects:
University projects are larger in scope and developed by groups of 6–7 students, with each student responsible for a portion of the work. Personal projects are generally smaller in scope and primarily developed by me, unless otherwise noted.
